# Project QLOP: Quantitative Leverage Opportunity Predictor

# Project Title: Quantitative Leverage Opportunity Predictor (QLOP)

**Brief Description:** QLOP is an advanced stock analysis and prediction tool designed to identify potential leverage opportunities in the stock market. It incorporates data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, backtesting, and provides insights through a GUI, CLI, and eventually an API.

## Key Features

## Key Features

- **Modular Design:** Core components (data, features, models, API) are separated for clarity and maintainability.
- **CLI Interface:** Provides command-line access to pipeline operations (`main.py`).
- **GUI Interface:** Streamlit-based GUI (`gui.py`) for interactive data analysis and model training.
- **Pydantic Configuration:** Type-safe configuration management using Pydantic models (`src/config_models.py`).
- **Versatile Modeling:** Supports XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Transformer models.
- **Advanced Backtesting:** Includes stubs for walk-forward and dynamic rolling window evaluations.
- **Metadata Tracking:** Generates metadata for trained models (`src/metadata_utils.py`).
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrates news sentiment analysis using Hugging Face transformers.
- **Fundamental Data:** Incorporates fundamental stock data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optuna integration for optimizing model parameters (`src/tuner.py`).
- **Dockerization Support:** Includes a `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment.
- **CI/CD Readiness:** Basic testing structure (`tests/`) and integrity checks (`check_pipeline_integrity.py`).
- **Auto-generated Documentation:** This README is auto-generated from modular sections.

- Technical Indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, etc.)
- Rolling Window Features (mean, std)
- Lag Features (price, volume, selected indicators)
- Sentiment Scores (daily aggregated from news)
- Fundamental Data (Revenue, Net Income, Assets, Liabilities, Cash Flow, etc.)
- Target Variable (binary classification based on future price change)

(More features to be listed as developed)

## Architecture

## Architecture Overview

This project follows a modular architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.

-   **`src/`**: Contains the core pipeline logic:
    -   `data_management.py`: Data loading and preprocessing.
    -   `feature_engineering.py`: Feature creation and selection.
    -   `modeling.py`: Model definitions, training, and prediction functions.
    -   `evaluation.py`: Model evaluation metrics and plots.
    -   `backtesting.py`: Backtesting strategies and execution.
    -   `tuner.py`: Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.
    -   `config_models.py`: Pydantic models for configuration validation.
    -   `metadata_utils.py`: Utilities for generating model metadata.
    -   `utils.py`: General utility functions, including logging and model saving/loading.
    -   `sentiment_analysis.py`: News sentiment fetching and analysis.
    -   `fundamental_data.py`: Fetching and processing fundamental stock data.

| Model File | Timestamp (UTC) | Key Metric(s) | Features Info |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| `sample_model_v1` | 2023-01-15T12:00:00Z | Acc: 0.950 | 3 (e.g., feat1, feat2...) |
| `Final_README_Model_Test` | 2023-10-29T15:05:00Z | Acc: 0.890 | 2 (e.g., final_feat1, final_feat2...) |

-   **`main.py`**: CLI entry point using `click`.
-   **`gui.py`**: Streamlit GUI application.
-   **`api/`**: For the future REST/gRPC API:
    -   `controllers.py`: API logic (currently stubs).
    -   `models.py`: API request/response Pydantic models (placeholders).
-   **`config/`**: JSON configuration files for different environments (dev, test, prod).
-   **`models/`**: Default directory for saved trained models and their metadata.
-   **`data/`**: For raw, processed, and feature data.
-   **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.
-   **`tests/`**: Unit and integration tests.
-   **`docs/`**: Documentation, including these auto-generated README sections.

(A more detailed architecture diagram will be added here.)
