## GUI Usage

The application provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Streamlit.

To launch the GUI:
```bash
streamlit run gui.py
```
The GUI allows for:
- Interactive data loading and visualization.
- Selection of features for engineering.
- Training and evaluation of various models.
- Placeholder for backtesting visualization.

For detailed GUI workflows, see [docs/workflows/](./docs/workflows/).
(Currently, GUI operations are refactored to call the CLI. Full interactivity for data display post-CLI calls is pending further development).
